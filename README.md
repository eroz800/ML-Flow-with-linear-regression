This assignment uses the California Housing dataset which contains information about housing in California. The target variable is the median house value for California districts in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The dataset includes features like median income, house age, average rooms, and geographical information. Our task is to build a regression model that predicts median house values using various feature engineering techniques and machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tuning.
